Consider Rancher if…

- You are already using Kubernetes locally or on a primary cloud provider.
- You do not have requirements for the host operating system
- You need more flexibility in the different components of your cluster
- You want to make more decisions about the components of your cluster
- You have limited resources and can start small, i.e., a single node cluster

Consider OpenShift if…

- You are already familiar with Red Hat products or have a Red Hat Subscription
- You run applications that require certification on the operating system
- You want to run air-gapped installations
- You want to manage a private registry
